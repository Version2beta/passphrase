passphrase
==========

Simple passphrase generator apropos http://xkcd.com/936/. Selects 12 random words from the configured dictionary. 

Here are some of my favorite example passphrases:

* mason's Hobbit barrets
* zamboni Bygone udders
* Advertisers dick dishonesty
* rheumiest Orphan cannonball
* bookworms Bullshit prognosis
* Oz's medicine storehouse
* dual Arabian iotas
* Windsor's armchair Typists

Current version requires a path to the dictionary, and expects to be placed in the path and executable.
